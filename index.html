            <h2>Why Personality Tests?</h2>
            <p>
                A personality test is completed to yield a description of an individualâ€™s distinct
                personality traits. In most instances, your personality will influence
                relationships with your family, friends, and classmates and contribute to your
                health and well-being. Teachers can administer a personality test in class to
                help your children discover their strengths and developmental needs. The
                driving force behind administering a personality test is to open up lines of
                communication and bring students together to have a higher appreciation for
                one another. A personality test can provide guidance to teachers of what
                teaching strategies will be the most effective for their students
            </p>

            <h2>About The Test</h2>
            <p>
                True Colors Personality Test is one of the most popular personality tests. This personality test asks a serious of questions to rate your likes and
                dislikes. The test will then rate your personality as either a blue, green, orange
                or gold personality type. You may be a combination of two colors, but usually
                a student will exhibit one primary color. A personality test is not a means to
                type cast a student, but it allows teachers to understand the personality
                attributes associated with various students. You will operate as one primary
                color for the most part, but high levels of stress and other environmental
                factors can shift your personality type for short intervals. As a rule of
                thumb, you should recognize your strong attributes and keep in mind the
                attributes that irritate people.
            </p>

                of school. A personality test is a fun exercise for the class and will enable
                the teacher to more adequately plan lessons and activities for their students.
